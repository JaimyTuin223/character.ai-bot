## Getting the required data
Before the installation we need to get some tokens and IDs for the bot to function.

#### Discord bot token.
Head over to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select an application or create one. Go to the Bot tab and select create bot. After doing this discord will show you the token to your bot.

âš  This token gives access to your bot. DO NOT give it to others or post it online.

#### Character.ai chatID.
This ID will be used to connect to your character AI chat bot. 

Go to the Character.AI website, create or open a bot chat and copy the id found at the end of the URL. (https://beta.character.ai/chat?char= **chatID**)

#### Character.ai access token.
This access token is how you use your account via the code. (You can also use a guest account, but this will include limitations)

1. Go to https://character.ai/ in your browser. 
2. Open the developer tools. (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or Cmd+J)
3. Go to the `Network` tab.
4. Set the type to `All`. (Positioned below the Filter bar)
5. Refresh the page and go to a AI character chat.
6. Find and select a request with a random string of characters as it name.
7. Copy the value behind token Authorization (`Token <copy this code>`)
