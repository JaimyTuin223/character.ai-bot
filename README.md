# Character.ai discord bot

This bot allows you to communicate with your character.ai bots inside a discord chat, making use of [node_characterai](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai).
Check the Branches section found below for more bot functionality than the base version!

> [!Warning]
> `Character.ai` has changed it's authentication method and broke the bot code.<br>
> Please use the new [C.ai bot v2](https://github.com/JaimyTuin223/character.ai-bot/tree/C.ai-bot-v2), this version is still functional.
>
> V2 will soon replace this branch, along with this change I'm planning on making a new YouTube video for it.


## Features

- Easily chatting with a custom character.ai bot.
- Easy setup!
- Support via discord server.

I will be adding some more fixes and changes in the near future!


## Getting the required data
Before the installation we need to get some tokens and IDs for the bot to function.

#### Discord bot token.
Head over to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select an application or create one. Go to the Bot tab and select create bot. After doing this discord will show you the token to your bot.

âš  This token gives access to your bot. DO NOT give it to others or post it online.

#### Character.ai chatID.
This ID will be used to connect to your character AI chat bot. 

Go to the Character.AI website, create or open a bot chat and copy the id found at the end of the URL. (https://character.ai/chat?char= **chatID**)

#### Character.ai access token.
This access token is how you use your account via the code. (You can also use a guest account, but this will include limitations)

1. Go to https://character.ai/ in your browser. 
2. Open the developer tools. (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or Cmd+J)
3. Go to the `Network` tab.
4. Set the type to `All`. (Positioned below the Filter bar)
5. Refresh the page and go to a AI character chat.
6. Find and select a request with `Resurrect` as it name.
7. Copy the value behind token Authorization (`Token <copy this code>`)

#### Help, I need a tutorial
If you need a setup tutorial, feel free to watch the installation on my [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opzsBka7vkk) (NOTE: This video has the outdated auth method)

## Installation

Below are the steps explained to set up all required stuff for the bot to run.

#### 1. Packages
First we install all packages by running the command below in the command line.
```bash
  npm i -y
```

#### 2. botConfig.json
Below is everything that needs to be set in the `botConfig.json` file. This uses the data we collected at "Getting the required data".
```json
{
    "token": "botToken",
    "characterID": "character.ai ChatID",
    "authToken": "character.ai char_token",
    "chatID": "discordChannelID"
}
```
## Deployment
